A simple blackjack game i created to help me improve my codeing skills and to understand the workings of python. 
I also wanted to use lists more and how to modify them. The rules of the gamer ios where the player goes first and has the options to pick up another card or not.
If the player decideds to pick up a card the new card is add to the players total. if they refuse it then becomes the computes turn if their score is over 17 they do not pick up another
card and their scire is calculated and compared to mine.
